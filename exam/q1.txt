Question 1

(a) How many key comparisons will be performed while searching for the 
    key 60 in the tree?

    4 searches will be done. 


(b) What is the minimum possible number of key comparisons that would be
    required in a successful search in the tree?

    minimum would be root search. The only key searched in this case would be the key(integer)
    42. Thus, only 1 search done. 

    List all the search keys that would cause this.
    42


(c) What is the maximum possible number of key comparisons that would be
    required in a successful search in the tree?
    6 key searches for nodes at very end (51 and 33)


    List all the search keys that would cause this.
    To search for 51: 42->69->50->60->55->51
    To search for 33: 42->20->36->30->32->33


(d) What is the minimum possible number of key comparisons that would be
    required in an unsuccessful search in the tree?
    4 comparisons made


    Give two different search key(s) that would cause this.
    15 or 42
